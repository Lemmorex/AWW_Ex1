Matterhorn, one of the best-known mountains (14,692 feet [4,478 metres]) in the Alps, straddling the frontier between Switzerland and Italy, 6 miles (10 km) southwest of the village of Zermatt, Switzerland.Though from the Swiss side it appears to be an isolated horn-shaped peak, it is actually the butt end of a ridge.
