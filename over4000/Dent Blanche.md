The Dent Blanche (4357m) is a largely ice-free peak in the Valais High Alps... with its name possibly originating from a cartographic mix-up. (Blanche = white). Dent Blanche is just 10km west of Zermatt, between the Val d'Herens, Val d'Anniviers and Mattertal, on the linguistic divide between French and German in the Upper Valais.
