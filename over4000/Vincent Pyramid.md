The "last mountain" The Vincent Pyramid rises dramatically to the south of the Colle Vincent (4,087 m). When seen from the Balmenhorn (4,167 m), the Vincent Pyramid looks like the "last mountain", with an abyss beyond. This is almost correct, as Alagna (1,190 m) is just eight kilometres from the peak as the crow flies.
